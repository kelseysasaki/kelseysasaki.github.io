<h3>Discourse Processing</h3>
	<h4>Long-distance pronominal anaphora</h4>
In discourse, one or more clauses may separate an anaphor and its antecedent. Very little is known about how these long-distance pronominal anaphora are processed.
	Previous findings on pronominal anaphora resolution between adjacent clauses support the broad hypothesis that any factor that modulates antecedent prominence can modulate long-distance pronoun resolution, 
	such that greater antecedent prominence leads to lower processing costs. Meanwhile, some formal discourse theories—notably, Segmented Discourse Representation 
	Theory (SDRT; Asher & Lascarides 2003)—posit that pronoun resolution is determined by what they call the Right Frontier Constraint (RFC; Polanyi 1988), 
	which I argue is an essentially grammatical constraint on discourse structure-building. 
	I further argue that SDRT does not straightforwardly predict that any factor besides the RFC should modulate intersentential pronoun resolution. 
	Through a combination of stops-making-sense task and Maze task studies, I have found evidence suggesting that, as SDRT predicts, RFC-violating 
	pronominal anaphora may be harder to process than their RFC-observing counterparts. However, contra SDRT’s predictions, 
	I also found that prominence-modulating factors—here, lexical semantics and animacy—may modulate that effect. 
	However, it remains to be seen whether prominence-modulating factors can fully account for long-distance pronominal anaphora processing; 
	my ongoing work---in collaboration with <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~panand/">Pranav Anand</a> and 
	<a href="https://rysling.sites.ucsc.edu">Amanda Rysling</a>---is testing for effects of more such factors.

	<h4>Clause-internal coherence</h4>
Most work on coherence relations focuses on cross- sentential contexts, or at least cross-clausal ones (Hoek et al. 2021). 
	However, it has also been proposed that CIC is also possible---that is, a discourse interpretation may arise from a single clause (Hobbs 2010). 
	For instance, a causal coherence inference may be drawn from the monoclausal, 
	<i>A drenched child got hit by a big water balloon</i>---namely, a child was drenched because she got hit by a big water balloon. 
	In joint work with <a href="https://danielaltshuler.com">Daniel Altshuler</a> and <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~hrohde/">Hannah Rohde</a>
	on English, we have found offline evidence suggesting 
	that both adjectives and nouns can give rise to CIC inferences, which in turn suggests that proposition-like content can be extracted from adjectival 
	and nominal elements. Our ongoing work is exploring the implications of this for formal semantics and pragmatics; in particular, we are developing an 
	account that adopts Schwarzschild’s (2022) Pure Event Semantics, in which adjectives and nouns are treated as one-place predicates of eventualities. 
	We are also testing whether the online processing of CIC parallels that of cross-clausal coherence.
	
  
  <h3>Exclamatives and exclamative-embedding predicates</h3> 
In joint work with <a href="https://www.uu.nl/staff/TDHRoberts">Tom Roberts</a>, we are investigating the semantics of exclamatives using corpus studies and acceptability judgment 
	studies on English. There is no consensus on what type of semantic object exclamatives denote. In many languages, their form resembles that of 
	interrogatives, which has motivated analyses of exclamatives as special questions (Grimshaw 1979). However, the interpretive function of exclamatives 
	is to express surprise, often at the degree to which a certain property holds, which has motivated analyses of exclamatives as predicates of degrees 
	(Rett 2008) and as facts (Ginzburg & Sag 2000). We focus on embedded wh-exclamatives, as in <i>Annie knows what a cute hippo Moo Deng is</i>, in order to 
	separate the semantics of exclamatives from their conventional discourse effects (following Karttunen 1977 on interrogatives). We provide corpus and 
	experimental evidence for a novel empirical generalization: a predicate V can take wh-exclamative complements iff V is wh-responsive, and vice versa. 
	(A predicate is wh-responsive iff it can take declarative complements and wh-interrogative complements.) We argue that this points to an analysis of 
	exclamatives as questions that presuppose a particular answer (Zanuttini & Portner 2003), and supports the view that responsive predicates s-select for 
	questions (Uegaki 2016). In our ongoing work, we are testing whether the proposed empirical generalization holds cross-linguistically and seeking ways 
	to account for the unembeddability of other kinds of English exclamative (e.g., <i>Wow, is she a cute hippo!</i>).
